## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Open-props](https://open-props.style/)

Responsive portfolio page build with Astro...

Features:

- Astro layout and prop passing
- fetching and parsing tweets with a react component
- custom carousel / scroller

## Optimizations

project data is local, I may look into using a CMS to streamline the process of adding/editing new work
could be fun to demo more components from different libraries

## Lessons Learned / Demonstrations of:

- using [luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) to work with times
- fetching tweets from the twitter API with a React component loading when visible
- parsing raw tweet data and links with [linkify](https://github.com/Hypercontext/linkifyjs)
- open-props for color, typography and sizing variables
- ðŸ‘€
